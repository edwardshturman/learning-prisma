# `/sandbox`

This is a monorepo where directories represent a new language, framework, or tool I'm learning. It could be a project, or it could be a single file. The point is to enable high-quality, low-stakes experimentation, without committing to a full project in its own repo.

Also inspired by swyx's [Learning in Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/).
